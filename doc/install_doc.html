      <h2>What is EJ?</h2>
      <div class="page-content">
        <p>
          An Electronic Journal (EJ) is a digital record-keeping system used in
          Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) to log all transaction activities and
          system events. Each EJ contains detailed entries of user interactions
          with the ATM, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries,
          and error messages. This electronic log serves as a comprehensive
          source of information for both operational monitoring and regulatory
          compliance.
        </p>

        <h2>Importance of EJ</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Transaction Tracking:</strong> EJs are crucial for
            maintaining a clear and accurate record of every transaction
            conducted at the ATM. This tracking ensures accountability and
            provides a reliable source of information for resolving disputes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operational Analysis:</strong> The data captured in EJs
            enables financial institutions to analyze ATM usage patterns,
            identify peak transaction times, and assess machine performance.
            This insight helps optimize ATM operations and improve customer
            service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fraud Prevention and Detection:</strong> By logging all
            transactions, EJs play a vital role in preventing and detecting
            fraudulent activities. In the event of discrepancies or suspicious
            behavior, the detailed logs allow for thorough investigations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Financial institutions are
            required to maintain accurate transaction records to comply with
            industry regulations. EJs provide the necessary documentation for
            audits and regulatory reviews, ensuring compliance and reducing
            legal risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>System Monitoring:</strong> EJs are often integrated with
            monitoring systems that automate the tracking of ATM performance and
            security. These systems can detect irregularities in real-time,
            facilitate log rotation, and ensure data integrity through regular
            backups.

            <h3>1. <span class="filename">EJMonitoringService.exe</span></h3>
            <p>
                This file is a customized version of the Windows Service Wrapper (<strong>WinSW</strong>) and has been renamed to <span class="filename">EJMonitoringService.exe</span>. It is designed to manage and monitor the <span class="filename">ej_live.exe</span> executable, ensuring continuous operation and alerting in case of interruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The metadata required for this service is defined in <span class="filename">EJMonitoringService.xml</span>. Below are key commands available for managing the <span class="filename">EJMonitoringService</span> on Windows:
            </p>
            
 <pre class="language-shell">
EJMonitoringService.exe install    # Install EJMonitoringService as a Windows Service
EJMonitoringService.exe start      # Start EJMonitoringService after installation
EJMonitoringService.exe status     # Check the status (running, stopped, or nonexistent)
EJMonitoringService.exe stop       # Stop EJMonitoringService if it is currently running
EJMonitoringService.exe uninstall  # Uninstall EJMonitoringService completely from Windows
</pre>
                

            <h3>2. <span class="filename">EJMonitoringService.xml</span></h3>
            <p>
               This is an XML file used to define the service and its metadata.

            <strong>Configuration Details:</strong>

            <li><strong>csv_path</strong>: Path to <span class="filename">ip_terminal_id.csv</span>, which maps IP addresses to terminal IDs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. <span class="filename">ip_terminal_id.csv</span></h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="filename">ip_terminal_id.csv</span> file contains a list of all IP and terminal ID pairs. It serves as a single source of truth, eliminating the need to set up terminal IDs for each ATM individually. 
            The script checks each ATM's IP against the entries in this file to retrieve the corresponding terminal ID. 
            After obtaining the terminal ID, the script constructs the EJ log name using the required format. For example, in our case, it would follow the pattern: <code>2024_10_28_ADMN0168.log</code>.

        <h3>5. <span class="filename">ej_live.exe</span></h3>
        <p>
            This is an executable file compiled from a Python script. It serves as the main program responsible for monitoring the primary <span class="filename">EJDATA.LOG</span> in NDC APTRA. The executable generates daily logs with formatted names based on specified requirements and saves them to the destination path: <code>E:\EJLOGS\LiveEJ\</code>.

        <h3>6. <span class="filename">monitoring_status.log</span></h3>
        <p>
            This file may not appear immediately but will be generated as the executable runs. It logs everything the script does, making it invaluable for investigating issues, such as crashes or date changes. Essentially, it keeps track of all significant events related to the script's execution.

        <h3>7. <span class="filename">last_run_date.txt</span></h3>
        <p>
            Similar to the previous files, this file may not be present at first but will be created once the script executes. It stores the last run time of the script, which is crucial when the ATM has been offline for several days. This information helps the script recognize when it last ran, allowing it to function correctly after a boot-up.

        <h3>8. <span class="filename">ServiceLogs</span></h3>
        <p>
            This directory is designated for storing logs generated by the service. Within this directory, there are three types of log files:

            <li><strong>stdout.log</strong>: This log records normal operations when starting the executable.</li>
            <li><strong>stderr.log</strong>: This log captures any errors the service may encounter.</li>
            <li><strong>EJMonitoringService.wrapper.log</strong>: This log tracks all activities related to the service, including failures to start and other critical events.</li>

         <h1>Installation Steps</h1>
         <p>Now that we have reviewed the overall application structure and its file components, let's see how to install it on an NCR ATM.</p>
        <p><strong>Attention:</strong> After completing these installation steps, remember to remove the existing scheduled task that runs at 11:30 PM using Task Scheduler. This is essential!</p>
      
         <h2> Step 1</h2>
         <p>Ensure the program is copied to the NCR ATM. You can transfer the files using Radmin or a USB drive if you are near the ATM.</p>
         <h2> Step 2</h2>
         <p>If the files are zipped, unzip them. It's recommended to extract them to the C Drive. You can name the folder "LiveEJ," "Live," or any standard name used by the bank. Make sure all the files mentioned at the beginning of this document are present in the folder.</p>
         <h2> Step 3</h2>
         <p>Once you have completed Step 2, run <strong>ej_live.exe</strong> to verify it operates with the configured settings (path.ini, ip_terminal_id.csv). If it runs successfully, the terminal will appear, and you should see output similar to this:</p>
         <pre class="language-shell wrapped">

</div>

<div class="page">
    <div class="page-content">
        <h2> Step 4</h2>
        <p>If Step 3 was successful, proceed to install it as a service.</p>
        <p>To do this, open the command prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory where the files are located, as shown below:</p>

        <h2> Step 6</h2>
        <p>The service is now installed successfully. Let's start the service using the command below:</p>

        </pre>

        <h2>Step 7</h2>
        <p>Now that the service is running, it won't automatically start if the ATM restarts. To fix this, run <strong>service_options.bat</strong>. This batch file executes two commands: <strong>sc config EJMonitoringService start= auto</strong>, which configures the service to start automatically at boot, and <strong>sc failure EJMonitoringService reset= 0 actions= restart/5000</strong>, which recovers the service from failure every 5 seconds and restarts it.</p>

Press any key to continue . . .
        </pre>

        <h2>Final Steps</h2>
        <p>Now that everything is set up successfully, make sure to disable the Task Scheduler that invokes the script to delete CoreEJ every night at 11:30 PM. If this schedule is not disabled, it can cause issues. After completing all steps, restart the ATM!</p>
